1) What is meant by the term input validation?

👉 정답: Checking input data to ensure it is acceptable before the program uses it.

2) What is defensive programming?

👉 정답: Writing code that anticipates and safely handles invalid, unexpected, or malicious input.

3) How will input validation help you avoid unintentional errors?

👉 정답: It prevents invalid data from entering the program, reducing crashes and unexpected behavior.

4) How will input validation help you avoid malicious input?

👉 정답: It filters out harmful input that could exploit the program or cause security issues.

5) What is reasonableness check?

👉 정답: A test to see if the input value makes sense and falls within a logical range.

6) What is a check digit? How is a check digit used to detect data entry errors?

👉 정답: A digit added to the end of a number used to verify correctness by performing a mathematical check.

7) Name three types of unintentional input errors.

👉 정답: Typos, transposition errors, and omissions.

8) What is a transposition error? Give an example.

👉 정답: Reversing the order of digits or characters (e.g., typing 42 as 24).

9) What is a duplication error? Give an example.

👉 정답: Accidentally repeating a character or digit (e.g., typing 455 instead of 45).

10) How can prompt messages help prevent input errors?

👉 정답: By clearly explaining what type of input is expected.

11) Name three preventative measures public interface designers use to reduce input errors.

👉 정답: Dropdown menus, input masks, and confirmation messages.

12) What is GUI spam?

👉 정답: Creating excessive or unnecessary windows, messages, or interactions that annoy or confuse users.

1. Which Direction flag setting causes index registers to move backward through memory when executing string primitives?

➡ 정답: DF = 1 (SETD)

2. When a repeat prefix is used with STOSW, what value is added to or subtracted from the index register?

➡ 정답: ±2 (DF=0이면 +2, DF=1이면 −2)

3. In what way is the CMPS instruction ambiguous?

➡ 정답: It does not specify how many elements to compare; it compares elements and updates flags but does not tell if the arrays are equal or which is larger unless combined with REP prefixes.

4. When the Direction flag is clear and SCASB has found a matching character, where does EDI point?

➡ 정답: The position after the matching character.

5. When scanning an array for the first occurrence of a particular character, which repeat prefix would be best?

➡ 정답: REPNE (or REPNZ)

6. What Direction flag setting is used in the Str_trim procedure from Section 9.3?

➡ 정답: DF = 0 (CLD)
(항상 앞으로 진행)

7. Why does the Str_trim procedure from Section 9.3 use the JNE instruction?

➡ 정답: To loop until a non-matching character is found.

8. What happens in the Str_ucase procedure from Section 9.3 if the target string contains a digit?

➡ 정답: It is unchanged (the ASCII test passes it through).

9. If the Str_length procedure from Section 9.3 used SCASB, which repeat prefix would be most appropriate?

➡ 정답: REPNE (scan until null terminator)

10. If the Str_length procedure from Section 9.3 used SCASB, how would it calculate and return the string length?

➡ 정답:
EDI ends on the null byte → length = (EDI − start address − 1)

11. What is the maximum number of comparisons needed by the binary search algorithm when an array contains 1,024 elements?

➡ 정답:
log₂(1024) = 10 comparisons

12. In the FillArray procedure (Binary Search example), why must DF be cleared with CLD?

➡ 정답:
To ensure forward movement in string operations (STOSD).

13. In the BinarySearch procedure, why could the statement at label L2 be removed without affecting the outcome?

➡ 정답:
It simply repeats boundary checking already done in the loop.

14. In the BinarySearch procedure, how might the statement at label L4 be eliminated?

➡ 정답:
By merging the comparison logic into the loop body or rearranging the condition so the redundant jump is unnecessary.
